# Sarcasm-Detection
Python-based Sarcasm Detection Model: A sentiment analysis program designed to detect sarcasm in text using natural language processing techniques. The program analyzes textual data to identify sarcastic statements and provides insights into sentiment polarity with a focus on sarcastic expressions. It utilizes machine learning algorithms and linguistic features to accurately detect and classify sarcastic content, enabling applications in sentiment analysis, social media monitoring, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset file (Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset.json) consists of news headlines with a label of whether the headline is sarcastic or not. 

## Implementation
Implemented on python.
1. Clean the dataset by removing URLs.
2. Lemmatize the dataset.
3. Generate Sentiment Scores for headlines and make an analysis.
4. Generate 21 features for the headlines for learning model.
5. Creation of 2 SVMs (N-grams based and feature selection based).
6. Train both SVMs. 
7. Merge both SVMs to generate a result.
